.. _install-method:

The Salt Project provides a public repository for packages at the
`Salt Project Package Repo <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`__.

The preferred method for installing Salt is using distribution packages. This
method ensures that:

* All dependencies are met.
* Salt is installed in a tested and distribution-aligned way.

.. Note::
    Salt is often distributed in split packages, but only the ``salt-master``
    and ``salt-minion`` packages are required for Salt to function.
