.. Warning::

   The Salt Project will support the old packaging system until the 3007 release.
   After that time, Tiamat will become the standard packaging system for the
   Salt Project. The following instructions explain how to install Salt using
   the old packaging system, but you should consider upgrading to Tiamat soon.
   See :ref:`upgrade-to-tiamat` for more information.
