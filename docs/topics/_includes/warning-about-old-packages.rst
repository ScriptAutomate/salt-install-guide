.. Warning::

   The Salt Project will support the old packaging system until the 3007
   release. After that time, onedir will become the standard packaging system
   for the Salt Project. The following instructions explain how to install Salt
   using the old ("classic") packaging system, but you should consider upgrading
   to onedir soon. See :ref:`upgrade-to-onedir` for more information.
