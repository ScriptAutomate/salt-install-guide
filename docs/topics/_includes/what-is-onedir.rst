.. admonition:: **What is onedir?**

   Onedir is the Salt Project's new packaging system. Onedir packages of Salt
   include the version of Python needed to run Salt and Salt's required
   dependencies.

   Beginning with the release of Salt 3006 LTS (Sulfur), the Salt Project has phased
   out classic package builds for supported operating systems. Update your Salt
   infrastructure to the onedir packages as soon as possible. See
   :ref:`upgrade-to-onedir` for more information.
