Welcome to the Salt download page!

* Salt packages are hosted on `repo.saltproject.io <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`_.
* Unsupported versions can be found in the `PY2 archive repository <https://archive.repo.saltproject.io/salt/py2/>`__
  and the `PY3 archive repository <https://archive.repo.saltproject.io/salt/py3/>`_.

The following sections provide links to the repository for each operating
system as well as links to the installation instructions for each operating
system.

.. Tip::
    As a security best practice, always verify that you have downloaded Salt
    from the authorized site by comparing the SHA/MD5 of the package or by
    verifying the package URL is an official Salt repository.
