Manual install directions by operating system
=============================================

These instructions explain how to manually install Salt on various operating
systems. See :ref:`overview` for an overview of the steps involved in installing
Salt.

.. Warning::
    Pay close attention to package versions when navigating
    `repo.saltproject.io <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`_. For example,
    if you are using a RedHat 7 variant, make sure you select RedHat and then
    select version 7. Otherwise, you will get the wrong repo and will install
    RedHat 8 Salt packages on a RedHat 7. Version incompatibility will throw
    unknown errors.
