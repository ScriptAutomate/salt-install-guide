===========================
Support for Python versions
===========================

Starting with Salt version 3006, the Salt Project aligns with the
`Python support lifecycle <https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions>`_,
which means that Salt supports the same versions of Python that are supported by
the `Python Software Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_.


Currently supported versions
----------------------------
Salt |release| requires Python 3.7 or higher.
