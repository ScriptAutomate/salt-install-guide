Uninstall Salt
==============

The process for removing Salt depends on the operating system and the method you
used to install Salt:

* **Linux-based systems** - If the operating system uses package management
  tools (such as ``yum`` or ``apt``), then you would use the package manager to
  uninstall. For example: ``yum remove <package name>`` or
  ``sudo apt remove <package name>``.
* **macOS and Windows** - The macOS and Windows installers have an uninstall
  option. Run the installer and select that option to uninstall Salt if you run
  that.
* **Pip** - If you installed Salt using pip, then you can use pip to uninstall
  Salt. For example: ``pip uninstall [package name]``.
